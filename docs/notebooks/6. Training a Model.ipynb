    "# Training a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [last notebook](https://www.pybroker.com/en/latest/notebooks/5.%20Writing%20Indicators.html), we learned how to write stock indicators in **PyBroker**. Indicators are a good starting point for developing a trading strategy. But to create a successful strategy, it is likely that a more sophisticated approach using predictive modeling will be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, one of the main features of **PyBroker** is the ability to train and backtest machine learning models. These models can utilize indicators as features to make more accurate predictions about market movements. Once trained, these models can be backtested using a popular technique known as [Walkforward Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBZ_Vv-iMv4), which simulates how a strategy would perform during actual trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explain Walkforward Analysis more in depth later in this notebook. But first, let's get started with some needed imports!"

    "In summary, we have now completed the process of training and backtesting a linear regression model using **PyBroker**, with the help of Walkforward Analysis. The metrics that we have seen are based on the test data from all of the time windows in the backtest. Although our trading strategy needs to be improved, we have gained a good understanding of how to train and evaluate a model in **PyBroker**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please keep in mind that before conducting regression analysis, it is important to verify certain assumptions such as [homoscedasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoscedasticity_and_heteroscedasticity), normality of residuals, etc. I have not provided the details for these assumptions here for the sake of brevity and recommend that you perform this exercise on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also not limited to just building linear regression models in **PyBroker**. We can train other model types such as gradient boosted machines, neural networks, or any other architecture that we choose. This flexibility allows us to explore and experiment with various models and approaches to find the best performing model for our specific trading goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyBroker also offers customization options, such as the ability to specify an [input_data_fn](https://www.pybroker.com/en/latest/reference/pybroker.model.html#pybroker.model.model) for our model in case we need to customize how its input data is built. This would be required when constructing input for autoregressive models (i.e. ARMA or RNN) that use multiple past values to make predictions. Similarly, we can specify our own [predict_fn](https://www.pybroker.com/en/latest/reference/pybroker.model.html#pybroker.model.model) to customize how predictions are made (by default, the model's ```predict``` function is called).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this knowledge, you can start building and testing your own models and trading strategies in **PyBroker**, and begin exploring the vast possibilities that this framework offers!"
